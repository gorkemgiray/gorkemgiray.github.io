I am a software engineer and IT executive with a multidisciplinary background spanning computer engineering, business administration, and philosophy. I hold a Ph.D. and B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Ege University, an MBA from Koç University, and a B.A. in Philosophy from İstanbul University.

With over two decades of industry experience, I have held various technical and leadership roles — from Software Engineer to Regional IT Director — driving digital transformation and IT strategy across global operations.

Alongside my professional career, I have served as a part-time lecturer, teaching courses on Software Engineering and Project Management.

Since October 2025, I have been serving as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the İzmir Institute of Technology and a Guest Researcher with the Software Engineering & Technology (SET) Group at Eindhoven University of Technology.

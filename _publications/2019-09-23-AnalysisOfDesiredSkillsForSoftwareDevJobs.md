Understanding the desired skills in software industry is critical in many aspects, including designing university curricula, organizing trainings, launching online courses, guiding software developers for self-development. To this end, we crawled and analyzed 1,597 job ads from kariyer. net to find most desired technical and soft skills in Turkish software development industry. Our analysis reveals a substantial demand for experience in SQL, JavaScript and HTML/CSS languages in line with the recent trends worldwide. ASP .NET and MS SQL Server are the dominant web framework and database whose knowledge is needed most in job ads according to our dataset. Knowledge on Linux operating system is the most desired skill consistent with StackOverflow developer survey 2019 results. Visual Studio is the most desired development environment and .NET is the dominant framework. According to our dataset, experience on only a few software testing tools are sought by employers. The most desired soft skills are team work, communication and analytical/problem solving skills.

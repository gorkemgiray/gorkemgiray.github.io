It is generally believed that the application of methods plays an important role in developing quality systems. A development method is mainly necessary for structuring the process in producing large-scale and complex systems that involve high costs. Similar to the development of other systems, it is important for IoT systems to be developed in a systematic manner in order to achieve a proper system with respect to both the functional and nonfunctional requirements. Development methods for IoT systems are more complex than traditional software systems and possess challenges from the process perspective. So far, several IoT system development methods (SDMs) have already been proposed in the literature, but an overview and evaluation of SDMs for IoT is still missing.

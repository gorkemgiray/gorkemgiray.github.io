Large-scale software development organizations generally carry out multiple software development projects simultaneously. Teams use various software development processes and tools to implement these projects. In this context, the main challenges of the practitioners are (1) keeping track of the status of a single project where hybrid set of tools exist for different software life cycle activities (2) effectively monitoring a consolidated status of multiple projects that use hybrid processes and tools. To address these challenges, it is vital to have a unified view of these projects independent from these hybrid processes and tools. To this end, we report on our preliminary experiences on the development of a unified project monitoring solution and a corresponding tool support based on the Essence framework's language and kernel. Our solution provides an up-to-date and unified view of projects by collecting data from various tools automatically as well as allowing manual data entry.
